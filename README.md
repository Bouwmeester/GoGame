# GoGame
This project is my version of the Game GO in java. 
It contains a server, client and game package. 
At this moment it is possible to set up a client server connection and make moves on the board. 
Not all the rules of the game are implemented. 



Getting Started

Hardcoded 
Port, change the port to the preferred port both client and server.
Host, host is the  local host, 
Board, size of the board is 13 everywhere.
Color, first player plays with Field.BLACK.


Game Progress
Run the server, this will ask for a client.
Run client 2x, this will start a Game when appropriate input is given.
Use MOVE$int_int, to make moves
